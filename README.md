# Python_HW3
Stephaniie McNutt

I am new to GitBash. I some how currupted my connection between guthub and gitbash. After a couple hours of failed attempts to push my files I had to make a new repository.
I plan to review gitbash/git hub with my tutor. I am starting to understand but am still not comfortable using it. I was able to successfully push but this repository only shows the commits for part of the PyPoll repository.

Now that I am finished with the assignment I am feeling comfortable with push to the repository.

I found this assignment challenging to get started but once I got going everything made sense. A couple things I struggled with figuring out how to count the votes but eventually figured out a way to do it. I also struggled with rounding to 3 decimal places. It also took me a couple tries to save to the analysis folder, it kept saving in PyBank or PyPoll. I was finally able to get it to save to the analysis folder.
