# Python_HW3
Stephaniie McNutt

I am new to GitBash. I some how currupted my connection between guthub and gitbash. After a couple hours of failed attempts to push my files I had to make a new repository.
I plan to review gitbash with my tutor. I am starting to understand but am still not comfortable using it. I was able to successfully push but this repository only shows the commits for part of the PyPoll repository.
